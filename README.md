## Features :

1. ### React State:

I are using the useState hook from React to manage various states such as tasks, isTodoEditable, editedTask, and filterPriority.

2. ### React Icons:

I am importing and using icons from the react-icons library (AiFillDelete, AiFillEdit, AiFillSave) to represent delete, edit, and save actions.

3. ### Custom Hook - useTask:

I am using a custom hook called useTask, which is likely responsible for managing the state related to tasks.

4. ### Conditional Rendering:

I use conditional rendering to display different UI elements based on the state. 

5. ### Task Status Toggle:

I have a button to toggle the status of a task between 'completed' and 'incomplete'.

6. ### Editing Tasks:

I provide functionality to edit tasks by allowing users to input new values for task title and description.

7. ### Saving Edited Tasks:

There's a button to save edited tasks, updating their title and description.

8. ### Deleting Tasks:

I have a button (delete icon) to delete tasks.

9. ### Priority Filtering:

I include a PriorityFilter component to filter tasks based on priority levels.

10. ### Local Storage Implementation:
I have implemented local storage to persist tasks, ensuring that user tasks are saved even if they refresh the page.

10. ### Styling with Tailwind CSS:

I am using Tailwind CSS classes to style my components, including setting background colors, text sizes, and flex layouts.
